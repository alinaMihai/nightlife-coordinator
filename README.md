Basejump: Build a Nightlife Coordination App  

- website: http://nightlife-coordinator.herokuapp.com/
- reference challenge: http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/basejump-build-a-nightlife-coordination-app

Implemented user stories: 
- User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area;
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight;
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there; 

The application uses Google Maps and Google Places API and geolocation to find bars, open at the time of the query in your area. 

You can also search for other locations, using the autocomplete functionality from google maps. 

Using a twitter account, users can specify that they are going to a specific place tonight and also see how many people said they'll go there today.
